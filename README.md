🌸 Iris Classification Project – Playing with Data, Visualizing & Learning
🔍 Overview
In this project, I explored the classic Iris dataset using multiple machine learning algorithms:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Logistic Regression (Linear Model)

Decision Tree Classifier

The main focus was not just on model accuracy, but learning how to play with data, explore it deeply, and visualize it meaningfully to understand patterns.

🎯 Goals
Understand the structure of the Iris dataset

Visualize features to spot trends and clusters

Try different classification models and compare results

Learn how data behavior changes with each model

🧠 What I Learned
🌐 How to explore real-world data and identify what features matter

📊 How to plot data (pair plots, histograms, decision boundaries, etc.)

🧪 How to apply KNN, Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees

🧮 How model performance varies based on parameter tuning and data scaling

🧼 How to preprocess data for better results

📚 The difference in interpretability and flexibility of linear vs. tree-based models

📊 Visualization Techniques Used
Seaborn pair plots to visualize feature relationships

Heatmaps for correlation

Scatter plots with class coloring

Decision boundary plots (2D for visualizing classifier regions)

These helped in intuitively understanding how different species are spread across feature spaces.

📦 Tech Stack
Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Scikit-learn (KNN, LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, train_test_split, etc.)

✅ Results
Each model performed well on the simple Iris dataset, but the real win was gaining confidence in:

Manipulating and understanding datasets

Plotting to reveal insights

Choosing the right model based on data patterns

Model	Accuracy (approx)
Logistic Regression	~97%
KNN (k=3)	~96%
Decision Tree	~100% (overfitting potential noted)

🔗 Inspiration
This project is one of the first steps in my ML journey — helping me interact with real data, visualize decision boundaries, and see ML come alive.
